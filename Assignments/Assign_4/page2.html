            <h1>5 pillars</h1>
            
            <p>Every building is built upon pillars. Similarly, Islam has 5 pillars 
            upon which the religion is built. 
                
                <h3>1. Shahadah (testimony of faith)</h3> 
                <p>It is to testify that there is none worthy of worship except 
                Allah, and that the Prophet Muhammad is his final messenger. </p>  
                
                <h3>2. Salah (prayer)</h3>
                <p>It is to establish the 5 daily prayers with sincere humility and gratitude. Prayer is what differentiates 
                    believers from non-believers. 
                </p> 


                <h3>3. Sawn (fasting)</h3>
                <p>It is to fast during the month of Ramadan (one of the months of the Islamic lunar calendar, or Hijri calendar). During this month, Muslims leave not only food from dusk till dawn, but also leave off other temptations of the world and focus on trying to strengthen their connection with Allah and improve themselves. Ramadan is marked by the sighting of the new moon cresent at the end of the month of Sha'ban. The coming Ramadan is approximately on March 22. Here's a countdown! <p id="demo"></p> </p>   

                <h3>4. Zakat (charity)</h3>
                <p>Zakat is Arabic word that means to purify. Muslims  purify their wealth by giving 2.5% 
                of their savings every year to the poor, orphan, traveller, and some other groups. 
                </p> 

                <h3>5. Hajj (pilgrimage)</h3>
                <p>Muslims need to perform pilgrimage to Makkah atleast once in their lifetime if they are able to do so. </p> 
            
            </p>
