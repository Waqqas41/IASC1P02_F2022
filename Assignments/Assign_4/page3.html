					<h1>Quran &amp; Hadith</h1>
					<p>The Quran and Hadith are the two main sources of revelation to Muslims. The Quran is regarded as the literal revealed word of Allah. It is a guidance for all of mankind, for every time and place. The Quran has been perfectly preserved since it was first revealed over 1400 years ago. Muslims also believe in the earlier scriptures like the Torah and Bible, but they have been changed over time (even according to their own sources). Thus the Quran was revealed to correct their mistakes and 
                    serve as a criterion to determine the truth till the end of time.  
                            <br></br>
                    The Sunnah is the words, actions, and practices of the Prophet Muhammad. It is worth noting that the Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the "living Quran" (i.e he showed us how to understand and practice the Quran). The Sunnah is also considered to 
                    be revelation as Allah says the Prophet Muhammad does not act of his own will.
